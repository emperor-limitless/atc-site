Accessible Tab Converter — Support Site

Files:
index.html — support page with contact info and quick help
privacy.html — simple privacy policy for non-collecting apps

How to host on GitHub Pages:
1. Create a new repo (public is easiest), e.g., atc-site
2. Upload index.html and privacy.html to the root of the repo
3. Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Deploy from a branch
4. Branch: main, Folder: / (root). Save. Your site will appear at https://<yourname>.github.io/atc-site

Where to paste in App Store Connect:
Support URL → the full URL to index.html (e.g., https://<yourname>.github.io/atc-site/)
Privacy Policy URL → the full URL to privacy.html (e.g., https://<yourname>.github.io/atc-site/privacy.html)

Remember to replace the placeholder contact email in both files.
